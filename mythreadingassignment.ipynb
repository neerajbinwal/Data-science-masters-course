    "ANS1. Multithreading in Python is a popular technique that enables multiple tasks to be executed simultaneously. In simple words, the ability of a processor to execute multiple threads simultaneously is known as multithreading.\n",
    "Python multithreading facilitates sharing data space and resources of multiple threads with the main thread. It allows efficient and easy communication between the threads\n",
    "If you wish to break down your tasks and applications into multiple sub-tasks and then execute them simultaneously, then multithreading in Python is your best bet. All important aspects such as performance, rendering, speed and time consumption will drastically be improved by using proper Python multithreading.\n"

Then the first thread and second thread perform their operations on the value, and they race to see which thread can write the value last to the shared variable. The value of the thread that writes its value last is preserved, because the thread is writing over the value that the previous thread wrote.\n",
