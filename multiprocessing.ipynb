Applications in a multiprocessing system are broken to smaller routines that run independently. The operating system allocates these threads to the processors improving performance of the system.\n",

    "Ans 2 Key Difference Between Multithreading and Multiprocessing\n",
    "A multiprocessing system has more than two processors whereas Multithreading is a program execution technique that allows a single process to have multiple code segments\n",
    "Multiprocessing improves the reliability of the system while in the multithreading process, each thread runs parallel to each other.\n",
    "Multiprocessing helps you to increase computing power whereas multithreading helps you create computing threads of a single process\n",
    "In Multiprocessing, the creation of a process, is slow and resource-specific whereas, in Multiprogramming, the creation of a thread is economical in time and resource.\n",
    "Multithreading avoids pickling, whereas Multiprocessing relies on pickling objects in memory to send to other processes.\n",
    "Multiprocessing system takes less time whereas for job processing a moderate amount of time is taken."
