    "a.Artificial intelligence (AI) is a wide-ranging branch of computer science concerned with building smart machines capable of performing tasks that typically require human intelligence. While AI is an interdisciplinary science with multiple approaches, advancements in machine learning and deep learning, in particular, are creating a paradigm shift in virtually every sector of the tech industry.\n",
    "b.Machicne learning is an application of AI that enables systems to learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. Machine learning focuses on developing computer programs that can access data and use it to learn for themselves.\n",
    "c.Deep learning is a machine learning technique that teaches computers to do what comes naturally to humans: learn by example. Deep learning is a key technology behind driverless cars, enabling them to recognize a stop sign, or to distinguish a pedestrian from a lamppost. It is the key to voice control in consumer devices like phones, tablets, TVs, and hands-free speakers. Deep learning is getting lots of attention lately and for good reason. Itâ€™s achieving results that were not possible before.\n"

    "Ans3;-Unsupervised learning is a type of machine learning algorithm that looks for patterns in a dataset without pre-existing labels. As the name suggests, this type of machine learning is unsupervised and requires little human supervision and prep work. Because unsupervised learning does not rely on labels to identify patterns, the insights tend to be less biased than other forms of AI.\n",
