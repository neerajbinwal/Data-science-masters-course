    "Ans 1 Flask is a web framework, it’s a Python module that lets you develop web applications easily. It’s has a small and easy-to-extend core: it’s a microframework that doesn’t include an ORM (Object Relational Manager) or such features.\n",
    "\n",
    "It does have many cool features like url routing, template engine.\n",
    "Unlike the Django framework, Flask is very Pythonic. It’s easy to get started with Flask, because it doesn’t have a huge learning curve.\n",
    "\n",
    "On top of that it’s very explicit, which increases readability. To create the “Hello World” app, you only need a few lines of code."
