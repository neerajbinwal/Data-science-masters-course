Ridge Regression (L2 regularization) is a specialized technique used to analyze multicollinear data.1 It is most suitable when a data set contains a higher number of predictor variables than the number of observations, or when multicollinearity is experienced in a set.0 It is a fundamental regularization technique, but not used very widely due to the complex science behind it."
